### What is this?

This is a project for UCSD's CSE 112. This is the front end portion and interfaces with an ExpressJS REST API with a MongoLab database. This was built with a client in mind and took around 6 weeks of development. This was forked from another repo, but practically everything on that was tossed and rewritten.
